# PhysicsLab

## Background

Thousands of students struggle with Physics concepts every year, from high school to college. Here is a simple visualization of the core principles that makes up an introductory Physics course.

Users will be able to add inputs into Physics equations to see an accurate visualization of the concepts such as gravity, velocity, projectile motion, friction, force, tension, and spring constant. 

## Functionality & MVP

Users can select one topic mentioned above and will be able to:
1. See a demo of the equation as it would appear in the physical world.
2. Change inputs of an equation.
3. Equations with missing varible(s) can be solved and visualized.
4. Each topic/equation will be have a separate solver and animation.

## Architecture and Technologies

The following technologies are used:
1. JavaScript logic and solver.
2. Canvas for animation.

## Bonus Feature

Each topic/equation is a stand alone feature, completing an introductory Physics 1 course is the goal. Adding any equations from Physics 2 are bonuses.
